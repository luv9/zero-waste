npm install express

For mongo installation and setup, please follow the instructions from official website.

For running mongodb server on MacOS(M1):
Open a new terminal window. Run the following commands:

brew services start mongodb-community@6.0

mongod --config /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf --fork
